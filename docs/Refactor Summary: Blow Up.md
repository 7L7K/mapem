✅ Refactor Summary: "Blow Up" Phase

🔥 Mission
We safely migrated your frontend to a feature-based folder structure without deleting any original files until you’re 100% sure.

🧠 Old Setup

Everything was under frontend/src/, a bit cluttered with mixed responsibilities:

App.jsx, index.jsx, Providers.jsx
Pages + Components all jumbled
Context, utils, styles in loose folders
🧰 What We Built

We used the blow_up.sh script (aka King‑proof refactor bomb) to:

🔎 Verify required files exist
📦 Create snapshot of frontend/ as a ZIP (frontend_backup_*.zip)
🗂 Scaffold new feature-based layout in: frontend/src2/
📁 Move files into structure below (no deletion, only cp)
🧱 Generate boilerplate files: router.jsx, main.jsx, useDebounce.js, Tailwind + Vite config
✅ Leave old frontend/src/ untouched so you can confirm and rename manually
🧱 New Folder Layout

Located at: frontend/src2/

📦 Archived Legacy Files

Moved manually into: frontend/archive/

list_files_to_txt.py
header_oldthat i liked and worked.jsx

⚠️ Common Errors Fixed

1. Double-nesting in SRC_ROOT
# BAD:
OLD_SRC="frontend/src"
NEW_SRC="frontend/src"

# FIXED:
OLD_SRC="frontend"
NEW_SRC="frontend/src2"
2. Missing file triggers
If something like index.jsx was missing, script would fail gracefully with a message:

❌ Required file missing: frontend/index.jsx
💡 Try restoring a backup: unzip frontend_backup_*.zip -d frontend/
✅ What’s Working Now

You can run your app from frontend/src2/
All new folders are populated and organized
src2 is the working, clean version
src is your legacy staging folder
archive/ holds leftover unneeded files
